# Polliwog-My-First-Game-Engine
I am currently developing my own game engine in C++ with the help of a small graphics library called Azul. The code I have so far involves Asset, Scene, and Game Object Management, as well as a small Camera class and a spaceship(Frigate) and world plane to help me test the code. Very foundational code that I will need to expand on and optimize as I implement more systems. I hope to upload more in the future, but I'll keep this here in case anyone wants to see what I'm up to.
